Every IPFS storage tool (Pinata, Web3.Storage, Nft.Storage) will have its own individual media library and be able to access all of them in the plugin admin panel. In other words, when users retrieve images from IPFS storage tools, the images will be added to the respective media library and can be easily managed. Worth mentioning that the media retrieving process is just a few simple clicks and your IPFS-retrieved images are ready to use on your WP site. Not only displaying the images retrieved from the IPFS storage tools, but users can also edit the image details with our image lightbox editor, and apply SEO to the IPFS-retrieved image assets. Furthermore, by toggling on the IPFS image block (Elementor addons) at the dashboard, users can now easily use their IPFS-retrieved images on their WP site with the help of the popular WordPress website builder, Elementor.
